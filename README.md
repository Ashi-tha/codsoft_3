ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification
A machine learning project that classifies Iris flowers into three species â€” Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica â€” using sepal and petal measurements. This dataset is widely used for learning classification tasks.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Uses Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM.

Compares model accuracies.

Visualizes decision boundaries.

Beginner-friendly implementation.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
File: IRIS.csv

Rows: 150 samples

Features:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

Target: Flower species (3 classes)

ðŸ“Š Model Performance
Model	Accuracy
Logistic Regression	~96.7%
Decision Tree	~96.7%
Random Forest	~96.7%
SVM	~96.7%

ðŸŽ¨ Visualization
The project includes decision boundary plots for each model, showing how classifiers separate the flower species based on petal length vs petal width.

ðŸš€ Learnings
Basics of supervised machine learning.

Training & evaluating multiple models.

Understanding classifier differences via visualization.
